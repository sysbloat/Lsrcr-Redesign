**Suggestion title:** Keeping the Wanted Level Even after quitting the game
**Suggestion description:** 
This suggestion was discussed with other members of the community and what it basically means is that when a criminal quits the game and re joins (whenever - no particular time frame - he could join under 30 minutes or he could rejoin after an year) his wanted level will stay the same. 
Hence quitting and rejoining the game will no longer remove your wanted level and will not allow you to escape from cops. 
We can add a few spawn points for criminals such as Glen Park, Idlewood, Jefferson, East Los Santos, Market etc. Even if they select groups/factions while spawning, they will just spawn at the place with the old skin and the same wanted level.
**Suggestion pictures:** None
**Suggestion benefits:** A lot of benefits: 1. criminals dont get rid of their wanted levels unless they: Either die on their own (gas station, jumping off a roof etc) or they get killed/ar by other criminals/cops respectively.
2. The number of crimes go up
3. A better gameplay 
**Suggestion side-effects:** No side effect known for now
